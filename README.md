# Log Analysis Using Regular Expressions

This is the final project for the second course, ***Using Python to Interact with the Operating System***, a part of Google's ***IT Automation with Python*** Professional Certificate

This project assumes an arbitrary situation where a system administrator needs to view and analyze a system log to find out (1) the types of errors being generated, (2) the frequency of each error, (3) a list of users each with their corresponding frequency of successes and errors.

The goal is to generate a CSV file containing the information mentioned above and display them using a HTML (which won't be included in this repo.)
